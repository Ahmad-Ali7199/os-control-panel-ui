# Operating System Simulator Project

This project is an interactive Operating System simulator built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a visual and practical understanding of various OS concepts such as:

- **Process Management** (create, suspend, resume, block, destroy, message passing, priority changes)
- **Memory Management** (Paging simulation, LRU page replacement)
- **I/O Device Management** (assigning devices to processes)
- **Process Scheduling** (FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin)
- **Synchronization** (using Semaphores)

## 💻 Features

### 🌟 Process Management
- Create processes with different parameters (name, priority, memory, burst/arrival time).
- Suspend, resume, block, destroy processes.
- Dispatch and change priority.
- Process communication with message passing.

### 🗄️ Memory Management
- Paging simulator: visualize page tables, internal fragmentation.
- LRU page replacement algorithm simulation.

### 🖨️ I/O Device Management
- Select input/output devices and assign them to processes.
- Save and load device selections.

### ⚖️ Process Scheduling
- Simulate FCFS, SJF, Priority (Non-Preemptive), and Round Robin.
- Visual Gantt charts for each algorithm.
- Calculate turnaround time and waiting time.

### 🔒 Synchronization
- Semaphore-based synchronization simulation between multiple processes.

## 🖼️ Dashboard Images

Images used in the UI (stored in the `OS project pic` folder) must be included for the project to run properly.  

After downloading or cloning the repository, **make sure to unzip** `OS project pic.zip` to get the `OS project pic` folder in the root of your project.
